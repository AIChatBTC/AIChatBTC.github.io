    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Chat BTC (“we”, “us”, or “our”). We are committed to protecting
            your privacy and ensuring that any personal data we collect is handled
            in compliance with applicable data protection laws. This Privacy Policy
            explains how we handle information we may collect from you when you use
            our chatbot application (“Service”).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            Chat BTC does not require any personal information for general usage. We do not
            collect any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address,
            phone number, or payment details. The chatbot may process text inputs to provide
            relevant responses, but these text inputs are not stored in a manner that can
            identify a unique individual.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
        <p>
            We use your text inputs solely to generate responses using our AI chatbot
            capabilities. We do not share or sell your inputs or any related information
            to third parties. All data usage is strictly for the purpose of improving
            and delivering the Service to you.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
            We do not share any personal information or chatbot interaction data
            with third parties. Should we ever need to share data for reasons such
            as legal requirements or service improvements, we will do so with your
            explicit consent or as otherwise required by law.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take appropriate administrative, technical, and physical measures
            designed to safeguard your data against loss, theft, and unauthorized use,
            access, or modification. While we strive to protect the information and
            communications you send to us, no security measures are completely
            foolproof. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your data, but we
            continuously update and improve our measures.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not
            knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover
            that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will
            promptly delete such information from our systems.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect
            changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory
            reasons. When we update this Privacy Policy, we will revise the
            “Effective Date” at the top of this page. We encourage you to review
            this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our information
            practices.
